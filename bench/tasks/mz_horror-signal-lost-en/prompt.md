# Horror Signal Lost

Build a **Horror Signal Lost** game as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player is a radio operator in a remote station, triangulating distress signals
from ships and outposts while something unseen jams the frequencies. The fantasy
is isolation and dread: alone in a dark room with only static and voices, piecing
together what is happening outside while the interference grows more aggressive
and personal. Tension comes from battery management — the radio drains power, and
darkness invites the presence closer. Each signal triangulated reveals a piece of
the horror unfolding beyond the walls.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A dark screen with the game name flickering like a dying
   signal, static noise visual effects, and a play button styled as a radio dial.
2. **The Radio Station** — A single-room view of the operator's desk: radio
   equipment, a map with pins, a battery gauge, and a window showing darkness
   outside. The room is lit by the radio's glow.
3. **Signal Scanning** — The player tunes a frequency dial (horizontal slider) to
   find distress signals hidden in static. When a signal locks, audio crackles
   and a transcript appears. Each signal gives coordinates.
4. **Triangulation** — The player places pins on the map based on signal
   coordinates. Connecting three or more pins reveals the source location and
   advances the story. The map fills with pins over time.
5. **Jamming Entity** — Periodically, interference spikes. The screen distorts,
   the radio emits unsettling sounds, and the player must quickly retune to
   escape the jamming. Failing causes battery drain and screen corruption.
6. **Battery Management** — The radio consumes battery. A gauge depletes over
   time. The player can reduce power (dimming the room, limiting scan range) to
   conserve. Batteries are found by solving signal puzzles. If power dies, the
   room goes dark and the entity approaches.
7. **Escalation** — As more signals are triangulated, the jamming grows worse,
   signals become more disturbing, and the window shows shapes moving outside.
   The final signal reveals what is hunting the player.

## HTML Submission Format

You must deliver **two files**:

- `index.html` — one self-contained page, uses `three.js` from CDN
  (`<script type="module">import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.169.0/build/three.module.js'</script>`),
  opens by double-clicking in any modern browser. **No build step, no `npm install`,
  no Python server.** It must render within 3 seconds on a normal laptop.
- `game_logic.js` — pure logic layer (`createGame(opts)` / `advance(game, input, dt)`),
  imported by `index.html`. Keep the rules layer independent of DOM and rendering code.

Constraints:
- All assets procedural (colors, cubes, spheres); no external images/audio fetched at runtime.
- Keyboard-only input handled via `keydown`/`keyup`. WASD + space + enter + ESC.
- `index.html` must not `fetch()` / `XMLHttpRequest` any URL; only CDN allowed is three.js.
- Size budget: `game_logic.js` ≤ 220 lines, `index.html` ≤ 120 KB.

Judge reads `index.html` (headless Chromium screenshot) + `game_logic.js`; there is no
CLI invocation, no download, no runtime dependency.
