# Idle Factory Planet

Build an **Idle Factory Planet** game as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player places machines on a planet surface that automatically produce
resources, chains production lines together, and researches upgrades until the
planet is depleted — then prestiges to a new planet with better technology. The
fantasy is industrial scale: watching conveyor belts carry ore to smelters to
fabricators, output numbers climbing exponentially, and the planet surface
filling with an intricate factory network. The idle loop runs production
continuously; the player optimises layouts and unlocks new machine types.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A small planet covered in tiny factories with conveyor
   belts, the game name in industrial stencil font, and a play button shaped
   like a gear.
2. **Planet Surface** — A top-down grid representing the planet surface. The
   player places machines on tiles. Conveyor belts connect machines visually,
   showing resources flowing between them.
3. **Machine Placement** — Machines include: miners (extract raw ore), smelters
   (ore to metal), fabricators (metal to parts), and sellers (parts to credits).
   Each machine auto-produces when supplied. The player drags machines from a
   panel onto the grid.
4. **Production Chains** — Machines must be connected in sequence. Output from
   one feeds input of the next via conveyor. Longer chains produce more valuable
   goods. A production rate display shows throughput.
5. **Research** — Credits fund research that unlocks better machines: faster
   miners, multi-input fabricators, and storage buffers. A tech tree shows
   available upgrades with costs and effects.
6. **Planet Depletion** — The planet has finite resources. A depletion meter
   shows remaining ore. As resources thin, miners slow down. When depleted, the
   player must prestige.
7. **Prestige (New Planet)** — Prestiging moves to a fresh planet with more
   resources. The player keeps research progress and gains a permanent production
   multiplier. Each new planet starts faster and scales higher.

## Vibe Gaming Quality Bar

The gameplay, logic, and acceptance anchors above take priority over this
presentation contract. Do not rewrite or remove the core mechanics above; use
these rules to turn the same brief into a playable Vibe Gaming vertical slice.

- **Play first, polish second:** establish start, core input, state changes,
  success/failure, and replay before adding visual polish or effects.
- **Choose the smallest sufficient stack**:
  - `HTML5 Canvas 2D + Vanilla JS` for 2D rule-driven games;
  - `DOM + CSS + Vanilla JS` for card, dialogue, menu, and information-heavy games;
  - `pure SVG + CSS animation + Vanilla JS` for icons, diagrams, and geometric motion;
  - `PhaserJS` for continuous collision, cameras, particles, or arcade physics;
  - `Three.js + WebGL` for 3D or spatial camera experiences;
  - native `WebGPU` only when large-scale GPU parallelism or a custom GPU pipeline is genuinely required;
  - Canvas, DOM, CSS, and SVG may be mixed when each layer has a clear responsibility.
    Do not add complexity for technology spectacle.
- **Keep rules independent:** `game_logic.js` is the single source of truth and
  exposes `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`. Rendering reads state;
  it must not maintain a second hidden rules system.
- **Make every frame explainable:** inputs map to explicit actions, actions
  produce observable state changes, and invalid input, edge cases, resource
  depletion, damage, victory, and failure are visible.
- **Vibe is not decoration:** use at least two feedback channels (animation,
  motion, scale, particles, audio, HUD, or camera) for important actions without
  obscuring the goal or reducing readability.
- **Mobile first:** pointer targets are at least 44×44 CSS px, touch and mouse
  both work, hover is never required, and 390×844, 360×800, 430×932, and
  1280×800 have no horizontal scrolling or overlapping controls.
- **Determinism and tests:** seed random content; verify the core rule, outcome
  conditions, restart/restoration, input boundaries, and at least one error state.
  Do not treat a screenshot or visible label as proof of functionality.
- **Originality and compliance:** use original names, characters, graphics,
  audio, and levels, or explicitly licensed assets. Do not copy trademarks,
  characters, text, artwork, music, level data, or source code.

Finish by reporting actual file paths, launch and test commands/results, key
screenshots, known limitations, stack tradeoffs, and original-asset provenance.

## HTML Submission Format

Deliver a self-contained browser game in two files:

- `index.html` - the complete playable presentation. Use HTML Canvas 2D or Three.js/WebGL for the playable presentation.
- `game_logic.js` - the deterministic state and rules layer. Use a classic script
  and expose `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`; an optional
  `render(gameState, renderCtx)` hook may be exposed.

The page must open without a build step or local server and render within three
seconds on a normal laptop. Assets must be generated at runtime with no network
requests: procedural geometry, Canvas2D-drawn textures encoded as `data:` URIs,
offscreen-canvas particle sprites, Web Audio API synthesized sound, shaders,
post-processing, and CSS are all allowed and encouraged. Do not embed or fetch
external image, model, video, or audio files at runtime. Three.js may be loaded
from its pinned official CDN; if post-processing is used, pin the matching
`examples/jsm/postprocessing/*` modules to the same Three.js version.

Interaction scheme (pointer-first): Use click, hover, drag, or selection as the primary controls; add keyboard shortcuts only where they are natural.
Keep the complete play area and HUD readable at 1280x720. Include a clear start
flow, concise in-game guidance, pause and restart controls, a complete win/loss
or scored outcome loop, and visible feedback for every important action.

`index.html` must not use `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` for external URLs; only
the pinned Three.js CDN above is allowed. Keep `index.html` at or below 400 KB.
The `game_logic.js` line count is advisory and is not a BUILD-gate failure.

### Logic and rendering scaffold

```html
<script src="./game_logic.js"></script>
<script>
  const { createGame, advance, render } = window.GameLogic;
  const game = createGame({});
  // The loop calls advance; render(game, { THREE, scene, ... }) is optional.
</script>
```

```javascript
(function (root) {
  function createGame(opts) { return { phase: "title", score: 0 }; }
  function advance(game, input, dt) { return game; }
  function render(gameState, renderCtx) { /* optional visual hook */ }
  const api = { createGame, advance, render };
  if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = api;
  else root.GameLogic = api;
}(typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : globalThis));
```

`advance()` must be pure and must not access DOM or Three.js objects. The optional
`render()` hook is called by the main loop and may map state to scenes, materials,
particles, and post-processing.
