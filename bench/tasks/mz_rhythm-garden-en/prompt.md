# Rhythm Garden

Build a Rhythm Garden as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A whimsical garden overworld connects a collection of eight or more timing
minigames, each themed around a different garden activity — watering flowers to
a beat, swatting bugs in rhythm, conducting a bird choir, bouncing seeds into
pots with timed taps. Each minigame teaches a different rhythmic skill (steady
pulse, syncopation, polyrhythm, call-and-response). Mastering individual games
unlocks a final "Remix" stage that weaves all mechanics together into one
climactic performance. The fantasy is a musical gardener tending a world that
blooms in response to rhythmic mastery.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A pastel garden scene with the game name in a playful
   hand-drawn font, flowers swaying to a gentle beat, and a "Play" button
   shaped like a watering can. No plain HTML grey.
2. **Garden Hub** — An overworld map showing garden plots, each representing a
   minigame. Completed games bloom with flowers; locked ones show wilted buds.
   The player clicks a plot to enter its minigame.
3. **Minigame Variety** — At least 8 distinct minigames, each with unique
   visuals and a different timing mechanic:
   - Tap to the beat (steady quarter notes)
   - Hold and release (sustained timing)
   - Call and response (echo a pattern)
   - Syncopation (off-beat hits)
   - Polyrhythm (two simultaneous patterns)
   - Speed ramp (accelerating tempo)
   - Pattern memory (repeat increasingly long sequences)
   - Free-form (improvise within a groove)
4. **Scoring** — Each minigame scores accuracy as a star rating (1-3 stars).
   Visual feedback during play shows timing quality with particle bursts for
   perfect hits and wilting effects for misses.
5. **Progression** — Earning stars unlocks later minigames. The garden visibly
   grows and blooms as the player progresses. New flowers, butterflies, and
   decorations appear with each milestone.
6. **Final Remix** — After completing all 8 minigames, a final challenge
   combines mechanics from multiple games into one extended performance. The
   remix transitions between styles every few measures.
7. **Results and Gallery** — A gallery screen shows total stars, best scores per
   minigame, and the fully-bloomed garden as a reward illustration.

## HTML Submission Format

You must deliver **two files**:

- `index.html` — one self-contained page, uses `three.js` from CDN
  (`<script type="module">import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.169.0/build/three.module.js'</script>`),
  opens by double-clicking in any modern browser. **No build step, no `npm install`,
  no Python server.** It must render within 3 seconds on a normal laptop.
- `game_logic.js` — pure logic layer (`createGame(opts)` / `advance(game, input, dt)`),
  imported by `index.html`. Keep the rules layer independent of DOM and rendering code.

Constraints:
- All assets procedural (colors, cubes, spheres); no external images/audio fetched at runtime.
- Keyboard-only input handled via `keydown`/`keyup`. WASD + space + enter + ESC.
- `index.html` must not `fetch()` / `XMLHttpRequest` any URL; only CDN allowed is three.js.
- Size budget: `game_logic.js` ≤ 220 lines, `index.html` ≤ 120 KB.

Judge reads `index.html` (headless Chromium screenshot) + `game_logic.js`; there is no
CLI invocation, no download, no runtime dependency.
