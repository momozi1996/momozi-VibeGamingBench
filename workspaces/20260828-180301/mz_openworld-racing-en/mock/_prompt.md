# Open-World Racing

Build a **2D open-world racing game** as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player drives a vehicle across a large open-world map with multiple
biomes, discovering and racing on scattered tracks. Each track has a unique
layout, terrain type, and time-trial record to beat. Tension comes from
momentum management — braking too late sends you off the road, drifting at
the right moment rewards a speed boost, and each biome demands a different
driving style. The art style should feel **fast, vibrant, and arcade-like** —
think *Burnout* meets *A Short Hike* at a smaller scale.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A styled opening with the game name, a play button, and
   a dynamic racing backdrop (speed lines, car silhouette, sunset highway).
   No naked HTML 引擎 grey.
2. **The World** — The player spawns in an open-world map with at least three
   visually distinct biomes: coastal road, desert canyon, and mountain pass.
   The vehicle can drive freely in all directions, exploring at will.
3. **Scattered Tracks** — Each biome contains at least one race track marked
   by a visible start/finish line and checkpoint gates. Tracks have different
   layouts suited to their terrain: long straights, tight switchbacks, or
   elevation hairpins.
4. **Vehicle Physics** — The vehicle accelerates, brakes, and steers with
   visible momentum. Drifting around corners produces a skid-mark trail and
   a brief speed boost when released. The vehicle sprite visibly tilts when
   turning.
5. **Timer and Records** — A lap timer starts when the player crosses the
   start line and stops at the finish. The HUD shows current lap time, best
   lap time, and a medal ranking (Gold/Silver/Bronze based on time).
6. **Track Unlocking** — Winning a bronze or better medal on one track unlocks
   the next track with a visible unlock animation. The player progresses
   through the world by earning medals.
7. **Speed Feedback** — A speedometer is always visible on the HUD. At high
   speed, the screen edges show a subtle motion-blur or speed-line effect.

## HTML Submission Format

You must deliver **two files**:

- `index.html` — one self-contained page, uses `three.js` from CDN
  (`<script type="module">import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.169.0/build/three.module.js'</script>`),
  opens by double-clicking in any modern browser. **No build step, no `npm install`,
  no Python server.** It must render within 3 seconds on a normal laptop.
- `game_logic.js` — pure logic layer (`createGame(opts)` / `advance(game, input, dt)`),
  imported by `index.html`. Same pattern as `bench/references/tg1/game_logic.js`.

Constraints:
- All assets procedural (colors, cubes, spheres); no external images/audio fetched at runtime.
- Keyboard-only input handled via `keydown`/`keyup`. WASD + space + enter + ESC.
- `index.html` must not `fetch()` / `XMLHttpRequest` any URL; only CDN allowed is three.js.
- Size budget: `game_logic.js` ≤ 220 lines, `index.html` ≤ 120 KB.

Judge reads `index.html` (headless Chromium screenshot) + `game_logic.js`; there is no
CLI invocation, no download, no runtime dependency.
