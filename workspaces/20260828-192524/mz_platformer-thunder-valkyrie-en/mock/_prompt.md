# Thunder Valkyrie

Build **Thunder Valkyrie**, a 2D vertical scrolling bullet-hell shoot-'em-up as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`). This is not a prototype. It is a **complete,
shippable micro-game** that could sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished
vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A lone starfighter threads through mathematically dense curtains of enemy fire,
where every pixel of the hitbox matters and every split-second dodge buys another
breath. The tension lives in reading bullet geometry: patterns sweep, spiral, and
converge while the player traces the one safe seam through the chaos. Between
sorties the pilot reinvests plundered gold into hull upgrades, sub-weapons, and
wingman attachments, reshaping how the next wave feels. The tone is bright,
kinetic, and relentless — an arcade reflex challenge wrapped in deep-space neon
and spectacular particle destruction.

## What the Player Experiences

A styled title screen introduces the game with a cosmic backdrop and a clear
path into the hangar.

In the hangar the player reviews their persistent loadout — starfighter level,
shield type, sub-weapon, wingman — and spends gold earned from prior runs to
upgrade slots. Each upgrade visibly changes projectile patterns or survivability
for the next sortie.

From a sector map the player selects a constellation stage. Each stage has a
distinct stellar backdrop and its own enemy composition. Locked stages remain
gated until the previous boss falls.

Once deployed, the screen scrolls vertically over a layered starfield. The
starfighter moves smoothly in response to input, its tiny glowing core hitbox
the only vulnerable point. Primary lasers fire continuously; sub-weapons and
wingmen add flanking fire. Waves of enemy interceptors enter in geometric
formations, releasing scripted bullet configurations that sweep downward. Elite
capital ships drop red power crystals; collecting them triggers a frenzy state
that doubles fire rate and vacuums nearby pickups.

Each stage culminates in a multi-phase boss that locks the scroll and floods the
arena with layered patterns. Taking damage degrades the shield; if it breaks the
run ends with a results overlay showing gold earned and waves survived. Defeating
the boss unlocks the next stage and awards premium components.

## HTML Submission Format

You must deliver **two files**:

- `index.html` — one self-contained page, uses `three.js` from CDN
  (`<script type="module">import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.169.0/build/three.module.js'</script>`),
  opens by double-clicking in any modern browser. **No build step, no `npm install`,
  no Python server.** It must render within 3 seconds on a normal laptop.
- `game_logic.js` — pure logic layer (`createGame(opts)` / `advance(game, input, dt)`),
  imported by `index.html`. Same pattern as `bench/references/tg1/game_logic.js`.

Constraints:
- All assets procedural (colors, cubes, spheres); no external images/audio fetched at runtime.
- Keyboard-only input handled via `keydown`/`keyup`. WASD + space + enter + ESC.
- `index.html` must not `fetch()` / `XMLHttpRequest` any URL; only CDN allowed is three.js.
- Size budget: `game_logic.js` ≤ 220 lines, `index.html` ≤ 120 KB.

Judge reads `index.html` (headless Chromium screenshot) + `game_logic.js`; there is no
CLI invocation, no download, no runtime dependency.
