# Cardgame Inscription Dark

Build a Cardgame Inscription Dark as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A dark and atmospheric card battle game where creatures are summoned by
sacrificing other creatures. The player places cards on a grid battlefield,
but powerful cards demand blood — weaker creatures must be sacrificed to fuel
stronger summons. Each card bears sigils (passive abilities) that create
emergent interactions: a card with "Airborne" flies over blockers; one with
"Bifurcated Strike" hits two lanes. An overworld map connects encounters with
branching paths, and a creeping meta-narrative unfolds through environmental
storytelling. The fantasy is the unsettling thrill of sacrificing your own
creatures for power, wrapped in a cabin-horror atmosphere.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A dimly lit wooden table with the game name scratched
   into the surface in rough lettering, a flickering candle, and a "Begin"
   card the player clicks. No plain HTML grey.
2. **The Table** — Battles take place on a 4-lane grid. The player's row faces
   the opponent's row. Cards are played from hand into lanes. Each card has
   attack power, health, a blood cost, and zero or more sigils.
3. **Sacrifice Mechanic** — To play a card costing 2 blood, the player must
   first sacrifice 2 of their own creatures already on the field. Sacrificed
   creatures die with a visual effect. Free cards (0 cost) serve as sacrifice
   fodder. This creates a constant tension between board presence and power.
4. **Sigils** — At least 8 distinct sigils with unique icons: Airborne (attacks
   directly), Bifurcated Strike (hits adjacent lanes too), Mighty Leap (blocks
   Airborne), Stinky (adjacent enemies lose 1 attack), Unkillable (returns to
   hand on death), Fledgling (evolves after 1 turn), Touch of Death (kills
   anything it damages), Many Lives (has 3 extra lives).
5. **Damage Scale** — A balance scale tips as damage is dealt. When one side
   takes 5 more total damage than the other, that side loses. The scale
   visually tips with each hit, creating tension as it approaches the tipping
   point.
6. **Overworld Map** — Between battles, a branching path map shows nodes:
   card battles, totem poles (add a sigil to a card), campfires (merge two
   cards), and traders (buy/sell cards). The player chooses their route.
7. **Atmosphere** — Dark, muted colour palette. Cards look hand-drawn on
   parchment. The opponent is a shadowy figure whose eyes glow. Ambient
   effects (dust motes, candle flicker) reinforce the unsettling mood.

## HTML Submission Format

You must deliver **two files**:

- `index.html` — one self-contained page, uses `three.js` from CDN
  (`<script type="module">import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.169.0/build/three.module.js'</script>`),
  opens by double-clicking in any modern browser. **No build step, no `npm install`,
  no Python server.** It must render within 3 seconds on a normal laptop.
- `game_logic.js` — pure logic layer (`createGame(opts)` / `advance(game, input, dt)`),
  imported by `index.html`. Keep the rules layer independent of DOM and rendering code.

Constraints:
- All assets procedural (colors, cubes, spheres); no external images/audio fetched at runtime.
- Keyboard-only input handled via `keydown`/`keyup`. WASD + space + enter + ESC.
- `index.html` must not `fetch()` / `XMLHttpRequest` any URL; only CDN allowed is three.js.
- Size budget: `game_logic.js` ≤ 220 lines, `index.html` ≤ 120 KB.

Judge reads `index.html` (headless Chromium screenshot) + `game_logic.js`; there is no
CLI invocation, no download, no runtime dependency.
