# Horror Signal Lost

Build a **Horror Signal Lost** game as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player is a radio operator in a remote station, triangulating distress signals
from ships and outposts while something unseen jams the frequencies. The fantasy
is isolation and dread: alone in a dark room with only static and voices, piecing
together what is happening outside while the interference grows more aggressive
and personal. Tension comes from battery management — the radio drains power, and
darkness invites the presence closer. Each signal triangulated reveals a piece of
the horror unfolding beyond the walls.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A dark screen with the game name flickering like a dying
   signal, static noise visual effects, and a play button styled as a radio dial.
2. **The Radio Station** — A single-room view of the operator's desk: radio
   equipment, a map with pins, a battery gauge, and a window showing darkness
   outside. The room is lit by the radio's glow.
3. **Signal Scanning** — The player tunes a frequency dial (horizontal slider) to
   find distress signals hidden in static. When a signal locks, audio crackles
   and a transcript appears. Each signal gives coordinates.
4. **Triangulation** — The player places pins on the map based on signal
   coordinates. Connecting three or more pins reveals the source location and
   advances the story. The map fills with pins over time.
5. **Jamming Entity** — Periodically, interference spikes. The screen distorts,
   the radio emits unsettling sounds, and the player must quickly retune to
   escape the jamming. Failing causes battery drain and screen corruption.
6. **Battery Management** — The radio consumes battery. A gauge depletes over
   time. The player can reduce power (dimming the room, limiting scan range) to
   conserve. Batteries are found by solving signal puzzles. If power dies, the
   room goes dark and the entity approaches.
7. **Escalation** — As more signals are triangulated, the jamming grows worse,
   signals become more disturbing, and the window shows shapes moving outside.
   The final signal reveals what is hunting the player.

## HTML Submission Format

Deliver a self-contained browser game in two files:

- `index.html` - the complete playable presentation. Use HTML Canvas 2D or Three.js/WebGL for the playable presentation.
- `game_logic.js` - the deterministic state and rules layer. Use a classic script
  and expose `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`; an optional
  `render(gameState, renderCtx)` hook may be exposed.

The page must open without a build step or local server and render within three
seconds on a normal laptop. Assets must be generated at runtime with no network
requests: procedural geometry, Canvas2D-drawn textures encoded as `data:` URIs,
offscreen-canvas particle sprites, Web Audio API synthesized sound, shaders,
post-processing, and CSS are all allowed and encouraged. Do not embed or fetch
external image, model, video, or audio files at runtime. Three.js may be loaded
from its pinned official CDN; if post-processing is used, pin the matching
`examples/jsm/postprocessing/*` modules to the same Three.js version.

Interaction scheme (both): Support both keyboard and pointer controls: use keyboard for movement or actions and the pointer for spatial selection, menus, or targeting.
Keep the complete play area and HUD readable at 1280x720. Include a clear start
flow, concise in-game guidance, pause and restart controls, a complete win/loss
or scored outcome loop, and visible feedback for every important action.

`index.html` must not use `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` for external URLs; only
the pinned Three.js CDN above is allowed. Keep `index.html` at or below 400 KB.
The `game_logic.js` line count is advisory and is not a BUILD-gate failure.

### Logic and rendering scaffold

```html
<script src="./game_logic.js"></script>
<script>
  const { createGame, advance, render } = window.GameLogic;
  const game = createGame({});
  // The loop calls advance; render(game, { THREE, scene, ... }) is optional.
</script>
```

```javascript
(function (root) {
  function createGame(opts) { return { phase: "title", score: 0 }; }
  function advance(game, input, dt) { return game; }
  function render(gameState, renderCtx) { /* optional visual hook */ }
  const api = { createGame, advance, render };
  if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = api;
  else root.GameLogic = api;
}(typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : globalThis));
```

`advance()` must be pure and must not access DOM or Three.js objects. The optional
`render()` hook is called by the main loop and may map state to scenes, materials,
particles, and post-processing.
