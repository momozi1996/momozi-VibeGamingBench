# Open-World Ghost Hunting

Build a **2D open-world ghost hunting game** as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player explores haunted locations across an open-world town, using
specialised equipment to detect, track, and capture ghosts. The game feels
**atmospheric, tense, and investigative** -- think *Phasmophobia* meets
*A Short Hike* at a smaller scale. The art style must be **coherent and
dark-atmospheric**: muted palettes, fog overlays, flickering light sources,
and readable sprites against shadowy backgrounds.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title and Entry** -- The player arrives at a styled title screen with a
   spooky backdrop (foggy graveyard, flickering lantern, silhouette of a house)
   and a "Begin Hunt" or "Play" button. Starting drops them into the open-world
   town hub.

2. **The Haunted World** -- The player walks freely across an open-world town
   with at least four visually distinct haunted locations: an abandoned mansion
   (dark, broken windows, overgrown garden), a haunted forest (twisted trees,
   fog, glowing eyes), an old lighthouse (coastal, waves, creaking wood), and a
   derelict hospital (corridors, flickering lights, wheelchairs). Each location
   has its own atmosphere and ghost type.

3. **Detection Equipment** -- The player carries at least three tools: an EMF
   reader (beep frequency increases near ghosts), a thermal camera (shows cold
   spots as blue overlays), and a spirit box (captures ghost voices as text).
   Each tool has distinct visual and audio feedback. Ghosts are invisible
   without equipment -- the tools are the only way to find them.

4. **Ghost Types and Evidence** -- At least four distinct ghost types with
   unique behaviours: poltergeist (throws objects), wraith (freezing breath,
   walks through walls), banshee (screams before attacking), and shade (hides
   in darkness, afraid of light). Each type leaves specific evidence that the
   player must collect and cross-reference on an evidence board to identify it.

5. **The Hunt Phase** -- When enough evidence is collected, the ghost becomes
   aggressive: lights flicker, the environment distorts, and a hunt timer
   counts down. The player must use defensive items (crucifix, salt circle,
   flashlight) to survive and capture the ghost before time runs out.

6. **Sanity and Pressure** -- A sanity meter drops in darkness, when seeing
   ghost activity, or when alone too long. Low sanity causes hallucinations
   (false readings, fake shadows) and makes the ghost more aggressive. Light
   sources and safe rooms restore sanity, creating a push-pull between
   investigation and self-preservation.

## HTML Submission Format

Deliver a self-contained browser game in two files:

- `index.html` - the complete playable presentation. Use HTML Canvas 2D or Three.js/WebGL for the playable presentation.
- `game_logic.js` - the deterministic state and rules layer. Use a classic script
  and expose `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`; an optional
  `render(gameState, renderCtx)` hook may be exposed.

The page must open without a build step or local server and render within three
seconds on a normal laptop. Assets must be generated at runtime with no network
requests: procedural geometry, Canvas2D-drawn textures encoded as `data:` URIs,
offscreen-canvas particle sprites, Web Audio API synthesized sound, shaders,
post-processing, and CSS are all allowed and encouraged. Do not embed or fetch
external image, model, video, or audio files at runtime. Three.js may be loaded
from its pinned official CDN; if post-processing is used, pin the matching
`examples/jsm/postprocessing/*` modules to the same Three.js version.

Interaction scheme (both): Support both keyboard and pointer controls: use keyboard for movement or actions and the pointer for spatial selection, menus, or targeting.
Keep the complete play area and HUD readable at 1280x720. Include a clear start
flow, concise in-game guidance, pause and restart controls, a complete win/loss
or scored outcome loop, and visible feedback for every important action.

`index.html` must not use `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` for external URLs; only
the pinned Three.js CDN above is allowed. Keep `index.html` at or below 400 KB.
The `game_logic.js` line count is advisory and is not a BUILD-gate failure.

### Logic and rendering scaffold

```html
<script src="./game_logic.js"></script>
<script>
  const { createGame, advance, render } = window.GameLogic;
  const game = createGame({});
  // The loop calls advance; render(game, { THREE, scene, ... }) is optional.
</script>
```

```javascript
(function (root) {
  function createGame(opts) { return { phase: "title", score: 0 }; }
  function advance(game, input, dt) { return game; }
  function render(gameState, renderCtx) { /* optional visual hook */ }
  const api = { createGame, advance, render };
  if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = api;
  else root.GameLogic = api;
}(typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : globalThis));
```

`advance()` must be pure and must not access DOM or Three.js objects. The optional
`render()` hook is called by the main loop and may map state to scenes, materials,
particles, and post-processing.
