# Cardgame Inscription Dark

Build a Cardgame Inscription Dark as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A dark and atmospheric card battle game where creatures are summoned by
sacrificing other creatures. The player places cards on a grid battlefield,
but powerful cards demand blood — weaker creatures must be sacrificed to fuel
stronger summons. Each card bears sigils (passive abilities) that create
emergent interactions: a card with "Airborne" flies over blockers; one with
"Bifurcated Strike" hits two lanes. An overworld map connects encounters with
branching paths, and a creeping meta-narrative unfolds through environmental
storytelling. The fantasy is the unsettling thrill of sacrificing your own
creatures for power, wrapped in a cabin-horror atmosphere.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A dimly lit wooden table with the game name scratched
   into the surface in rough lettering, a flickering candle, and a "Begin"
   card the player clicks. No plain HTML grey.
2. **The Table** — Battles take place on a 4-lane grid. The player's row faces
   the opponent's row. Cards are played from hand into lanes. Each card has
   attack power, health, a blood cost, and zero or more sigils.
3. **Sacrifice Mechanic** — To play a card costing 2 blood, the player must
   first sacrifice 2 of their own creatures already on the field. Sacrificed
   creatures die with a visual effect. Free cards (0 cost) serve as sacrifice
   fodder. This creates a constant tension between board presence and power.
4. **Sigils** — At least 8 distinct sigils with unique icons: Airborne (attacks
   directly), Bifurcated Strike (hits adjacent lanes too), Mighty Leap (blocks
   Airborne), Stinky (adjacent enemies lose 1 attack), Unkillable (returns to
   hand on death), Fledgling (evolves after 1 turn), Touch of Death (kills
   anything it damages), Many Lives (has 3 extra lives).
5. **Damage Scale** — A balance scale tips as damage is dealt. When one side
   takes 5 more total damage than the other, that side loses. The scale
   visually tips with each hit, creating tension as it approaches the tipping
   point.
6. **Overworld Map** — Between battles, a branching path map shows nodes:
   card battles, totem poles (add a sigil to a card), campfires (merge two
   cards), and traders (buy/sell cards). The player chooses their route.
7. **Atmosphere** — Dark, muted colour palette. Cards look hand-drawn on
   parchment. The opponent is a shadowy figure whose eyes glow. Ambient
   effects (dust motes, candle flicker) reinforce the unsettling mood.

## Vibe Gaming Quality Bar

The gameplay, logic, and acceptance anchors above take priority over this
presentation contract. Do not rewrite or remove the core mechanics above; use
these rules to turn the same brief into a playable Vibe Gaming vertical slice.

- **Play first, polish second:** establish start, core input, state changes,
  success/failure, and replay before adding visual polish or effects.
- **Choose the smallest sufficient stack**:
  - `HTML5 Canvas 2D + Vanilla JS` for 2D rule-driven games;
  - `DOM + CSS + Vanilla JS` for card, dialogue, menu, and information-heavy games;
  - `pure SVG + CSS animation + Vanilla JS` for icons, diagrams, and geometric motion;
  - `PhaserJS` for continuous collision, cameras, particles, or arcade physics;
  - `Three.js + WebGL` for 3D or spatial camera experiences;
  - native `WebGPU` only when large-scale GPU parallelism or a custom GPU pipeline is genuinely required;
  - Canvas, DOM, CSS, and SVG may be mixed when each layer has a clear responsibility.
    Do not add complexity for technology spectacle.
- **Keep rules independent:** `game_logic.js` is the single source of truth and
  exposes `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`. Rendering reads state;
  it must not maintain a second hidden rules system.
- **Make every frame explainable:** inputs map to explicit actions, actions
  produce observable state changes, and invalid input, edge cases, resource
  depletion, damage, victory, and failure are visible.
- **Vibe is not decoration:** use at least two feedback channels (animation,
  motion, scale, particles, audio, HUD, or camera) for important actions without
  obscuring the goal or reducing readability.
- **Mobile first:** pointer targets are at least 44×44 CSS px, touch and mouse
  both work, hover is never required, and 390×844, 360×800, 430×932, and
  1280×800 have no horizontal scrolling or overlapping controls.
- **Determinism and tests:** seed random content; verify the core rule, outcome
  conditions, restart/restoration, input boundaries, and at least one error state.
  Do not treat a screenshot or visible label as proof of functionality.
- **Originality and compliance:** use original names, characters, graphics,
  audio, and levels, or explicitly licensed assets. Do not copy trademarks,
  characters, text, artwork, music, level data, or source code.

Finish by reporting actual file paths, launch and test commands/results, key
screenshots, known limitations, stack tradeoffs, and original-asset provenance.

## HTML Submission Format

Deliver a self-contained browser game in two files:

- `index.html` - the complete playable presentation. Use HTML Canvas 2D or Three.js/WebGL for the playable presentation.
- `game_logic.js` - the deterministic state and rules layer. Use a classic script
  and expose `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`; an optional
  `render(gameState, renderCtx)` hook may be exposed.

The page must open without a build step or local server and render within three
seconds on a normal laptop. Assets must be generated at runtime with no network
requests: procedural geometry, Canvas2D-drawn textures encoded as `data:` URIs,
offscreen-canvas particle sprites, Web Audio API synthesized sound, shaders,
post-processing, and CSS are all allowed and encouraged. Do not embed or fetch
external image, model, video, or audio files at runtime. Three.js may be loaded
from its pinned official CDN; if post-processing is used, pin the matching
`examples/jsm/postprocessing/*` modules to the same Three.js version.

Interaction scheme (pointer-first): Use click, hover, drag, or selection as the primary controls; add keyboard shortcuts only where they are natural.
Keep the complete play area and HUD readable at 1280x720. Include a clear start
flow, concise in-game guidance, pause and restart controls, a complete win/loss
or scored outcome loop, and visible feedback for every important action.

`index.html` must not use `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` for external URLs; only
the pinned Three.js CDN above is allowed. Keep `index.html` at or below 400 KB.
The `game_logic.js` line count is advisory and is not a BUILD-gate failure.

### Logic and rendering scaffold

```html
<script src="./game_logic.js"></script>
<script>
  const { createGame, advance, render } = window.GameLogic;
  const game = createGame({});
  // The loop calls advance; render(game, { THREE, scene, ... }) is optional.
</script>
```

```javascript
(function (root) {
  function createGame(opts) { return { phase: "title", score: 0 }; }
  function advance(game, input, dt) { return game; }
  function render(gameState, renderCtx) { /* optional visual hook */ }
  const api = { createGame, advance, render };
  if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = api;
  else root.GameLogic = api;
}(typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : globalThis));
```

`advance()` must be pure and must not access DOM or Three.js objects. The optional
`render()` hook is called by the main loop and may map state to scenes, materials,
particles, and post-processing.
