# Tycoon: Village Farm

Build a **2D village-farm tycoon** as a self-contained, double-click-to-play HTML page (files: `index.html`, `game_logic.js`).
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player inherits a small plot of land and turns it into a living farm through
daily ritual. The fantasy is cozy accumulation — waking each morning to tend
crops that grew overnight, selling the harvest for just enough gold to plant
something new, and watching the homestead slowly fill with colour and life. The
interesting tension is that every day is finite: stamina runs out before
ambition does, so the player must choose which chores matter most right now.
The pressure is gentle but real — skip watering and crops stall, overextend and
tomorrow starts hungry. The risk is never catastrophic, just the quiet cost of
a wasted day. Over many mornings the farm transforms from bare dirt into a
thriving patchwork, and the satisfaction is entirely earned one tile at a time.

## What the Player Experiences

The player opens a saved farm or starts fresh and sees their homestead — a
fenced plot of tillable earth, a farmhouse, a shop, and water glinting at the
edge. Early mornings are simple: till a few squares, drop seeds, water them,
and head inside to sleep. Each action visibly marks the land and costs a sliver
of the day's energy.

As gold accumulates the player diversifies — new seed types with longer growth
but bigger payoffs, a fishing spot for side income, maybe an expanded field.
The daily loop stays the same but the decisions inside it deepen: which crops
to prioritize, when to harvest versus when to water the next batch, whether to
spend the last stamina fishing or saving it for tomorrow's planting.

Crops grow only overnight, so sleeping is the punctuation that gives each day
meaning. The morning reveal — seeing sprouts advance a stage, mature plants
ready to pick — is the hook that pulls the player into one more day. Progress
is banked at bedtime, so a returning player wakes to the same farm, the same
season of growth, and the same quiet momentum.

The art direction is warm, sunlit, cartoon-pastoral — greens, ochres, soft
wood — never naked HTML 引擎 grey. The tone is gentle and unhurried, the opposite
of a twitch game.

## Vibe Gaming Quality Bar

The gameplay, logic, and acceptance anchors above take priority over this
presentation contract. Do not rewrite or remove the core mechanics above; use
these rules to turn the same brief into a playable Vibe Gaming vertical slice.

- **Play first, polish second:** establish start, core input, state changes,
  success/failure, and replay before adding visual polish or effects.
- **Choose the smallest sufficient stack**:
  - `HTML5 Canvas 2D + Vanilla JS` for 2D rule-driven games;
  - `DOM + CSS + Vanilla JS` for card, dialogue, menu, and information-heavy games;
  - `pure SVG + CSS animation + Vanilla JS` for icons, diagrams, and geometric motion;
  - `PhaserJS` for continuous collision, cameras, particles, or arcade physics;
  - `Three.js + WebGL` for 3D or spatial camera experiences;
  - native `WebGPU` only when large-scale GPU parallelism or a custom GPU pipeline is genuinely required;
  - Canvas, DOM, CSS, and SVG may be mixed when each layer has a clear responsibility.
    Do not add complexity for technology spectacle.
- **Keep rules independent:** `game_logic.js` is the single source of truth and
  exposes `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`. Rendering reads state;
  it must not maintain a second hidden rules system.
- **Make every frame explainable:** inputs map to explicit actions, actions
  produce observable state changes, and invalid input, edge cases, resource
  depletion, damage, victory, and failure are visible.
- **Vibe is not decoration:** use at least two feedback channels (animation,
  motion, scale, particles, audio, HUD, or camera) for important actions without
  obscuring the goal or reducing readability.
- **Mobile first:** pointer targets are at least 44×44 CSS px, touch and mouse
  both work, hover is never required, and 390×844, 360×800, 430×932, and
  1280×800 have no horizontal scrolling or overlapping controls.
- **Determinism and tests:** seed random content; verify the core rule, outcome
  conditions, restart/restoration, input boundaries, and at least one error state.
  Do not treat a screenshot or visible label as proof of functionality.
- **Originality and compliance:** use original names, characters, graphics,
  audio, and levels, or explicitly licensed assets. Do not copy trademarks,
  characters, text, artwork, music, level data, or source code.

Finish by reporting actual file paths, launch and test commands/results, key
screenshots, known limitations, stack tradeoffs, and original-asset provenance.

## HTML Submission Format

Deliver a self-contained browser game in two files:

- `index.html` - the complete playable presentation. Use HTML Canvas 2D or Three.js/WebGL for the playable presentation.
- `game_logic.js` - the deterministic state and rules layer. Use a classic script
  and expose `createGame(opts)` and `advance(game, input, dt)`; an optional
  `render(gameState, renderCtx)` hook may be exposed.

The page must open without a build step or local server and render within three
seconds on a normal laptop. Assets must be generated at runtime with no network
requests: procedural geometry, Canvas2D-drawn textures encoded as `data:` URIs,
offscreen-canvas particle sprites, Web Audio API synthesized sound, shaders,
post-processing, and CSS are all allowed and encouraged. Do not embed or fetch
external image, model, video, or audio files at runtime. Three.js may be loaded
from its pinned official CDN; if post-processing is used, pin the matching
`examples/jsm/postprocessing/*` modules to the same Three.js version.

Interaction scheme (pointer-first): Use click, hover, drag, or selection as the primary controls; add keyboard shortcuts only where they are natural.
Keep the complete play area and HUD readable at 1280x720. Include a clear start
flow, concise in-game guidance, pause and restart controls, a complete win/loss
or scored outcome loop, and visible feedback for every important action.

`index.html` must not use `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` for external URLs; only
the pinned Three.js CDN above is allowed. Keep `index.html` at or below 400 KB.
The `game_logic.js` line count is advisory and is not a BUILD-gate failure.

### Logic and rendering scaffold

```html
<script src="./game_logic.js"></script>
<script>
  const { createGame, advance, render } = window.GameLogic;
  const game = createGame({});
  // The loop calls advance; render(game, { THREE, scene, ... }) is optional.
</script>
```

```javascript
(function (root) {
  function createGame(opts) { return { phase: "title", score: 0 }; }
  function advance(game, input, dt) { return game; }
  function render(gameState, renderCtx) { /* optional visual hook */ }
  const api = { createGame, advance, render };
  if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = api;
  else root.GameLogic = api;
}(typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : globalThis));
```

`advance()` must be pure and must not access DOM or Three.js objects. The optional
`render()` hook is called by the main loop and may map state to scenes, materials,
particles, and post-processing.
